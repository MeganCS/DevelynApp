## The Develyn App

The purpose of this app is to securely allow Develyn Students to sign up for seventh hour on their phones, while still allowing those without smart phones to sign up on school computers. 
In the future, features will be added to allow students to:
  - Vote in school elections
  - Participate in drawings and contests
  - Track and be rewarded for attendance of school events


### Running this project with the Ionic CLI:

cd into `DevelynApp` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
